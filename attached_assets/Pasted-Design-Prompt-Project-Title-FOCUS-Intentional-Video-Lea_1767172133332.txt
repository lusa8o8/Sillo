Design Prompt
Project Title: FOCUS – Intentional Video Learning Interface

Aesthetic Direction: Modern, ultra-minimalist, and premium. Design should follow a "Dark Mode" aesthetic using a palette of Deep Obsidian (#0B0B0B), Soft Slate Grays, and a single accent color like "Electric Cobalt" or "Emerald Mint" for progress indicators. Use high-quality typography (Inter, SF Pro, or Geist Sans). Avoid all clutter; every pixel must serve a functional purpose.

Screen 1: The Library (Dashboard)

Header: Minimalist. Left-aligned "FOCUS" logo in bold sans-serif. Right-aligned thin-line icons for "Add Vault" (+) and "Profile."

Active Focus Cards: Large, slightly rounded rectangles (16px radius) with a subtle 1px border.

Top: Category Title (e.g., Advanced Python).

Middle: A sleek, thin progress bar.

Bottom: Meta-data in small, muted gray text (e.g., 70% Complete • 3/10 Lessons).

Whitelisted Channels: A row of circular avatars with a subtle outer ring indicating "New Content." Labeled with the channel name in tiny, medium-weight text below.

The Intent Search: A centered, wide search bar with a "glassmorphism" effect (blurred background). Placeholder text: "Enter a specific learning query..."

Screen 2: The Zen Player

Header: A simple "Back" chevron and the Title of the current course.

Player: A 16:9 cinematic video container with no branding or overlay.

Notes Section: A clean, card-based area below the video. Bullet points should use the accent color for icons. High line-height for readability.

Footer Status: A persistent, thin bar at the bottom. Left side: "SESSION TIMER: 12:45" (Monospace font). Right side: "PROGRESS: 4/12."

Interaction: No sidebar, no recommendations, no comments. The background should be pure black (#000000) to make the video content pop.

General UI Requirements:

Use 8px grid spacing.

Use subtle drop shadows or "inner glows" on cards to create depth without using heavy colors.

The "Feel" should be "Executive Productivity Tool" (like Linear or Notion), not "Social Media."
